## 2025-02-05 – Blank page fix

### Task completed
- Resolved blank page on currix.nl: removed invalid video preload, added script load error handler, added deploy verification step

### Changes made
1. **index.html**: Removed `<link rel="preload" as="video">` to fix "unsupported as value" console warning
2. **index.html**: Added inline error handler that catches script load failures (e.g. 404) and shows "Failed to load" + Reload button instead of blank page
3. **deploy.yml**: Added "Verify build output" step to fail CI if dist/index.html contains dev path /src/main.tsx or missing /assets/ reference

### Root cause
Live site was serving index.html with script src="/src/main.tsx" (dev path) instead of built /assets/index-xxx.js. This suggests GitHub Pages may have been serving from branch source instead of Actions artifact, or caching old content.

### Next steps for user
1. Ensure Settings → Pages → Build and deployment = "GitHub Actions"
2. Push changes; workflow will deploy correct dist/
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) when testing

### Architectural decisions
- Inline error handler runs before module script; survives Vite build and catches 404 on main bundle
- Removed video preload (optional) to avoid browser compatibility warnings
